This repository is dedicated to the theoretical research and analysis of the NLS Network Sniffer, also known as NLS_874w.DLL. <b>For safety reasons, the actual malware samples are not included here.</b> `They can be found in my other repository focused on NLS_874w_DLL (SOON COMING)`. Additionally, for related research, you might want to check my Stuxnet repository.
